# Github Lab

 

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to set up the github repository you will use for the entire course. 

## Learning Objectives

* Ability to use basic git commands to create and push a repository. 
* Ability to create basic documentation in Markdown. 



## Task

You should already have solid git skills from other courses you have taken and this task will reinforce those skills. The goal, as stated above, is to create a git repository you will use for the entire course. When you create the repository on github, include a javascript .gitignore file and a readme.md file. WHen you create your Github repository make sure it is a private repository. Clone the repository to your local computer and make the necessary adds and commits and final push to match the contents shown here:

1. The `README.md` markdown file, as shown above. includes your name, email address, one or more Markdown headers, and a short sentence or two. 

2. `.gitignore` - Github will automatically create this file if you select  the  `.gitignore` option when you create the repository. Please select the `node` option of it.

3. The five folders are ones you create and should be named

   1. campground-nextjs
   2. campground-server
   3. food-app
   4. practice
   5. workshop-server

   Each of these contains a README.md file. Most of these can just be stubs, but minimally the workshop-server one should contain the markdown file containing the instructions for that project:

When you finish and push your changes, add me (username zacharski) as a contributor so I have access to your code:
