# Projects

#### Submitting your code

To submit your code you need to do four things:

1. develop and test your code on your development machine (your laptop). Do a thorough job testing and debugging.
2. save your code to Github (you should be doing this periodically as you get a new feature working)
3. clone your github code to your Google cloud virtual machine and get it running using NGINX as a reverse proxy and pm2.
4. test, debug, test. and test again
5. When confident that everything is working perfectly,  notify me by [filling our this form](https://forms.gle/Wymwd7ZoTvMs3vYL7). You will need to provide the external IP of your server running on Google Cloud, and the link to your github repository.
